21) What is the advantage of the generic collection?
There are three main advantages of using the generic collection.

If we use the generic class, we don't need typecasting.
It is type-safe and checked at compile time.
Generic confirms the stability of the code by making it bug detectable at compile time.
22) What is hash-collision in Hashtable and how it is handled in Java?
Two different keys with the same hash value are known as hash-collision. Two separate entries will be kept in a single hash bucket to avoid the collision. There are two ways to avoid hash-collision.

Separate Chaining
Open Addressing
23) What is the Dictionary class?
The Dictionary class provides the capability to store key-value pairs.

24) What is the default size of load factor in hashing based collection?
The default size of load factor is 0.75. The default capacity is computed as initial capacity * load factor. For example, 16 * 0.75 = 12. So, 12 is the default capacity of Map.

25) What do you understand by fail-fast?
The Iterator in java which immediately throws ConcurrentmodificationException, if any structural modification occurs in, is called as a Fail-fast iterator. Fail-fats iterator does not require any extra space in memory.

26) What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
The main differences between the Array and ArrayList are given below.

SN	Array	ArrayList
1	The Array is of fixed size, means we cannot resize the array as per need.	ArrayList is not of the fixed size we can change the size dynamically.
2	Arrays are of the static type.	ArrayList is of dynamic size.
3	Arrays can store primitive data types as well as objects.	ArrayList cannot store the primitive data types it can only store the objects.
27) What is the difference between the length of an Array and size of ArrayList?
The length of an array can be obtained using the property of length whereas ArrayList does not support length property, but we can use size() method to get the number of objects in the list.

Finding the length of the array

Int [] array = new int[4];  
System.out.println("The size of the array is " + array.length);  
          
Finding the size of the ArrayList

ArrayList<String> list=new ArrayList<String>();    
list.add("ankit");    
list.add("nippun");  
System.out.println(list.size());  
          
28) How to convert ArrayList to Array and Array to ArrayList?
We can convert an Array to ArrayList by using the asList() method of Arrays class. asList() method is the static method of Arrays class and accepts the List object. Consider the following syntax:

Arrays.asList(item)  
We can convert an ArrayList to Array using toArray() method of the ArrayList class. Consider the following syntax to convert the ArrayList to the List object.

List_object.toArray(new String[List_object.size()])  
29) How to make Java ArrayList Read-Only?
We can obtain java ArrayList Read-only by calling the Collections.unmodifiableCollection() method. When we define an ArrayList as Read-only then we cannot perform any modification in the collection through  add(), remove() or set() method.

30) How to remove duplicates from ArrayList?
There are two ways to remove duplicates from the ArrayList.

Using HashSet: By using HashSet we can remove the duplicate element from the ArrayList, but it will not then preserve the insertion order.
Using LinkedHashSet: We can also maintain the insertion order by using LinkedHashSet instead of HashSet.
The Process to remove duplicate elements from ArrayList using the LinkedHashSet:

Copy all the elements of ArrayList to LinkedHashSet.
Empty the ArrayList using clear() method, which will remove all the elements from the list.
Now copy all the elements of LinkedHashset to ArrayList.
